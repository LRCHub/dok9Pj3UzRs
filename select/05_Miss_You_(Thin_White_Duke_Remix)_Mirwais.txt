I miss you most of all
When those autumn leaves start to fall
Drifting by my window
They come up over the wall
Why does a good thing have to end?
Can't see it happen where and when? When the,
Cycle of change can be so cruel, you know
I've got no one to blame, I'm just a fool, you know
Hold on and keep on telling me
Something good's gonna come
The red and gold has put it's spell on me
And old man winter is gonna come
You know, he keeps on blocking up the sun
I miss you most of all
When they burn those bonfires tall
Smoking ashes fill the air
And the harvesters are everywhere
No time to waste, let's drink the wine

When the sun is a big and fiery ghost, you know
That is the time I miss you most
They say, hold on and keep on telling me
Something good's gonna come
The red and gold has put their spell on me
And old man winter is gonna come
You know, he keeps on blocking up the sun
Cold wind is hauling
And this dampness creeps in my bones
Seasons change, why didn't we?
Come on, bring that summer back to me
Hold on they keep on telling me
Something good's gonna come
The red and gold has put their spell on me
And old man winter is gonna come
You know, he keeps on blocking up the sun
Tell me why does he always have to come?
