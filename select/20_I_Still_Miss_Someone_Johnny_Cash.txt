And I still miss someone
At my door the leaves are falling
A cold wild wind will come
Sweethearts walk by together
And I still miss someone

No, I never got over those blue eyes
I see them everywhere
I miss those arms that held me
When all the love was there

I wonder if she's sorry
For leavin' what we'd begun
There's someone for me somewhere
And I still miss someone

, I never got over those blue eyes
I see them everywhere
I miss those arms that held me
When all the love was there.

I wonder if she's sorry
For leavin' what we'd begun
There's someone for me somewhere
And I still miss someone
(And I still miss someone)
